      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! I am a Research Engineer at [Gan.ai](https://gan.ai), helping machines speak!. Previously I was at Microsoft Bing Travel make their visual content make people go WoW :heart:. I am currently interested in using Deep learning to make awesome products.

During my undergrad I had the pleasure of working in various academic research labs and startups on topics ranging from Computer Vision, to NLP, finance, reinforcement learning. I was also involved in leading various undergrad research groups, focusing on Deep Learning, Core CS, Quantum Computing and Blockchain.

Professional stuff aside, I am a die-hard anime fan, an avid reader, wannabe Musician/Writer/Youtuber? lol (checkout my YT channel and Medium!) and a lifelong learner who's always up for a good conversation.
